# Description
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline that reads a clinical note in Dutch and assigns the functioning level of the patient based on the textual description.

We focus on 9 [WHO-ICF](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health) domains, which were chosen due to their relevance to recovery from COVID-19:

ICF code | Domain | name in repo
---|---|---
b1300 | Energy level | ENR
b140 | Attention functions | ATT
b152 | Emotional functions | STM
b440 | Respiration functions | ADM
b455 | Exercise tolerance functions | INS
b530 | Weight maintenance functions | MBW
d450 | Walking | FAC
d550 | Eating | ETN
d840-d859 | Work and employment | BER

### Functioning Levels
- FAC and INS have a scale of 0-5, where 5 means there is no functioning problem.
- The rest of the domains have a scale of 0-4, where 4 means there is no functioning problem.
- For more information about the levels, refer to the [annotation guidelines](https://github.com/cltl/a-proof-zonmw/tree/main/resources/annotation_guidelines).
- **NOTE**: the values generated by the machine learning pipeline might sometimes be outside of the scale (e.g. 4.2 for ENR); this is normal in a regression model.

# Input file
The input is a csv file with at least one column containing the text (one clinical note per row).

The csv must follow the following specifications:
- sep = ;
- quotechar = "
- encoding = utf-8
- the first row is the header (column names)

See example in [example/input.csv](example/input.csv).

# Output file
The output file is saved in the same location as the input; it has 'output' added to the original file name.

The output file contains the same columns as the input + 9 new columns with the functioning levels per domain.

The functioning levels are generated per row. If a cell is empty, it means that this domain is not discussed in this note (according to the algorithm).

See example in [example/input_output.csv](example/input_output.csv).

# Machine Learning Pipeline
The pipeline includes a multi-label classification model that detects the domains mentioned in a sentence, and 9 regression models that assign a level to sentences in which a specific domain was detected. All models were created by fine-tuning a pre-trained [Dutch medical language model](https://github.com/cltl-students/verkijk_stella_rma_thesis_dutch_medical_langauge_model).

The pipeline includes the following steps:
