=============

Sequel to the [a-proof](https://github.com/cltl/a-proof) project. We develop classifiers for functioning levels (based on [WHO ICF](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health)) in clinical notes (Dutch).

This is currently work in progress.
