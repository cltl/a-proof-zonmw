Data processing pipeline
========================
# Overview
The data pipeline consists of 4 steps:
1. Process raw data; see [data_process_raw/](data_process_raw/)
2. Select a batch and prepare it for annotation; see [data_process_to_inception/](data_process_to_inception/)
3. Process an annotated batch; see [data_process_from_inception/](data_process_from_inception/)
4. Prepare data for the machine learning pipeline; see [data_process_for_ml/](data_process_for_ml/)
