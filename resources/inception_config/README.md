INCEpTION config files
=====================
The files [tagset.json](tagset.json), [layer_relation.json](layer_relation.json) and [layer_token.json](layer_token.json) contain the configurations used throughout the a-proof-zonmw annotation process. These are the files that should be uploaded to INCEpTION when a new project is started.

The file [tagset_legacy_stella.json](tagset_legacy_stella.json) is the tagset used during the a-proof pilot annotations.

The file [tagset_week14.json](tagset_week14.json) was used in the first week of a-proof-zonmw (week 14), before the MBW domain was added.
