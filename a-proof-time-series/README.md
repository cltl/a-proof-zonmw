This Github is a mini project based on the a-proof and a-proof-zonmw, both developed by CLTL.
The goal is to build a time series analysis model to predict rehabilitation behavior per domain and level for a new patient overtime, using only synthethic labels from the icf-classifier developed by in the a-prrof project.

The synthetic labels generated by the icf-classifier for 9 WHO-ICF domains are:

The domains are as follows:

| Domain | Dataset
| :---         | :---        
| Energy level  | (ENR) | 
| Attention functions	 | (ATT) | 
| Emotional functions	 | (STM) | 
| Respiration functions	 | (ADM) | 
| Exercise tolerance functions	 | (INS) | 
| Weight maintenance functions	 | (MBW) | 
| Walking	 | (FAC) | 
| Eating	 | (ETN) | 
| Work and employment	 | (BER) | 

Functioning Levels
They are further identified regarding their levels to clinical text:
- FAC and INS have a scale of 0-5, where 5 means there is no functioning problem.
- The rest of the domains have a scale of 0-4, where 4 means there is no functioning problem.

For more details on the ICF domains and levels please refer to aproof-icf-classifier.

## Repository overview:

Thid repository contains 4 notebooks with the exploration, trend evaluation, feature engineering and modeling for the dataset described above.
It also contains figures and processed files that can help this project being reproduced.
